This tutorial adapts Unity's basic [Roll-a-Ball tutorial](https://unity3d.com/kr/learn/tutorials/s/roll-ball-tutorial) for the Bose AR glasses. Rather than using your keyboard arrows to roll the ball around, you're going to use the motion sensors embedded in your glasses to move the ball around by just moving your head!

We're assuming you're already somewhat familiar with Unity, but if not, go ahead and complete the Roll-a-Ball tutorial first. That'll teach you the basics of Unity. Once you're done, head on back here to get it working with your Bose glasses.

# Setup

Ok, let's get the basic Roll-a-ball working in Unity first. By the end of this setup, you should be able to use your keyboard arrows to win the game. Here's what you'll need to do:

1. Clone the repo `git clone git@github.com:shivpkumar/roll-a-ball_bose.git`
1. Open up Unity and open up the project you just cloned to your machine
1. Press play and use your keyboard arrows to roll the ball and collect pick-ups
1. Win!
